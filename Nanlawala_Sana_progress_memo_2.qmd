## Data Cleaning

The raw data originally contained **many** repetitive variables that
could be combined into one variable. Originally the bar_pass_prediction
dataset with 22407 observations on American students that entered law
school in 1991 (this study was collected over several year, allowing the data collectors to gather information on whether these students
graduated, passed the bar, etc) had 39 variables. However I was able to
limit this to 12 variables.

### Variables Kept and Adjusted:

-   'ID' was kept to keep each observation/student unique. (This might
    be removed later, but kept currently as EDA is being done)

-   'birth_year' was originally 'DOB_yr' but for changed for clarity.
    The values were also adjusted to prefix the number with '19' since
    all the birth years were in the 1900s but originally only showed the
    last two digits of the year.

-   'ugpa' is the undergraduate gpa

-   'lsat' is the lsat score

-   'grad' shows whether the student graduated law school

-   'fam_inc' shows family income separated by tiers (1-5)

-   'law_school_tier' was originally 'tier', showing what tier law
    school did the student attend (1-5 quintile)

-   'race', originally 'race1' is the student's race

-   'pass_bar' shows whether the student passed the bar. Most important
    for analysis.

-   'bar_passed_attempt' shows which attempt the student passed the bar
    (if at all).

-   'fulltime' shows if the student was a fulltime student

-   'gender' is the gender of the student

A lot of the factors, values, needed cleaning to be consistent with
similar factor types across the dataset. This can be explored further in
the clean_data.R file. There were also several variables in the raw
dataset that were not given any explanation to their meaning (after
extensive research)

## Univariate Analysis and General Distributions

Univariate analysis is proving to be the most confusing part of my dataset project because there is little information beyond identity of the students that are observed in this dataset. I feel that a lot of these analyses will be used for multivariate analyses later on, but I am including them here nonetheless. 

One of the variables I have done an analysis on is the birth year of the students. These students were all born sometime in the 1900s. Below is a simple graphic.
![](plots/birth_year_distribution.png)
We can see that this chart is left-skewed which makes most sense because you have to have gone to college before law school, and most college students are near the age of 18 when entering and 21-22 when leaving. However we have quite a few ouliers with people born as early as the 1920s. This could be a 'bad' observation but I will file it under people who are really interested in law, very late in their lives. I would love to see graduation rates in comparison to age as well as other variables against their birth year. 
Note: I am considering 'cleaning' my data further to just make the birth year into the age entering law school (i.e. age in 1991) in the future. 

## Multivariate Analysis

### Graduation Status vs. Bar Exam Pass

To explore students who graduated or did not graduate law school and if
they passed the bar exam, I constructed a simple bar plot. First I had
to omit observations that had any missing values, especially if students
didn't graduate law school and CHOSE not to attempt the bar exam.
(Remember this dataset shows students who at least attempted law school,
i.e. entered law school in fall of 1991).

Below shows the chart: 
![](plots/grad_bar_distribution.png) 
This may be
surprising to some, to see a small amount of students who had not
graduated and attempted the bar exam (with some even passing!). This is
because there are some states that require some amount of law school (as
in, not the full three years). These states are New York, Maine, and
West Virginia. The 65 students who passed the bar and the 24 students
who didn't pass the bar (both groups not graduating law school), must
have tried for their bar exam in any of these states.

There are also states that do not require ANY law school to attempt the
bar exam which are California, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.
However this dataset are all observations of students who entered law
school in 1991 so it is not applicable (unless the student immediately
dropped out, but that information is not available)

### Family Income vs. Law School Tier

Law school tiers (1 is the highest) is established by clusters 1-6 with
ugpas and LSAT scores (highest to lowest). This is something I found
after some research and will likely change the name of the variable in
the future (or maybe remove this variable entirely and separate the
comparison of fam_inc with lsat and ugpa separately)

However, here is a faceted histogram (with 6 graphs representing each
law school cluster): ![](plots/fam_inc_tier_distribution.png) This
information is not entirely useful until you look closely at the count
of each family income level. (1 being the smallest, 5 the highest)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fam_inc_tier <- na.omit(clean[c("fam_inc", "law_school_tier")])

fam_inc_tier |> 
  group_by(fam_inc)  |> 
  summarize(count = n()) |> 
  kable()
```

Clearly there is a large difference in the amount of students in this
dataset that are in the first family income level vs the others (with
the fourth highest income level having the most students). While this
does speak to the idea that law school is a financial commitment, we are
not sure how much of the students' families are contributing to their
tuition, but having a certain SES status growing up may impact your
decision to apply/enter law school for sure.

Looking at the student distribution among law schools (with tier 1 having students with the highest average undergraduate gpa and LSAT scores)
```{r, echo=FALSE}
fam_inc_tier |> 
  group_by(law_school_tier)  |> 
  summarize(count = n()) |> 
  kable()
```

I would like to continue this analysis further by finding the percent of students in each family income group going to each tier of law school. Currently this analysis is incomplete. 

### Race vs. Family Income 
I created a side by side boxplots to compare the race of the students with the family income. However, I think this is something that is not entirely related to law school (outside of these students entering law school), so I might move to appendix in the final form. 
![](plots/race_fam_inc_distribution.png)

### Family income vs. Fulltime Status
I wanted to explore whether there is a trend between students from different family incomes being in law school fulltime or parttime. 
I am struggling to find a way to best share a visualization that shows this (the issue is that the family income, while numeric, is just five factors 1-5). Currently here is a histogram.

## For the future:

I really want to narrow this project down in terms of relations between variables for the sake of having one direction with this project, but I feel that limiting myself is not something that will encompass all the different things that can be explored with this data. This means that I will likely have many different conclusions pertaining to different things, which I am hoping is fine. 

In terms of actual work: 
I want to do more obvious multivariate analyses as well as fix the formatting on all of my graphics with the labs() function. I want to cite my sources, create a codebook, executive summaries, and finalize the rest of the objectives in this project. I think I have a good understanding with what this data 'is', how it was collected, what each variables mean (after a long time of research) which has made things a lot smoother.

I have not done proper citations, however I am keeping a list for my
