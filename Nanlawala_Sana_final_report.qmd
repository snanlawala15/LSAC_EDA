# [Introduction]{.underline}

This report will conduct on exploratory data analysis on a study called
the LSAC National Longitudinal Bar Passage Study completed in 1998 by
Linda Wightman. This study focuses on 22,407 students who entered law
school in fall of 1991.

The motivation for this analysis was to explore not only the
demographics of law students entering law school in 1991, but to also
understand how these demographics have changed over the past two
decades. Law school is a large commitment, financially and otherwise,
and understanding how entrance into law school is important context when
examining higher education in America and the limitation of these
opportunities for certain students because of their background. While
personal identification-related variables such as race and gender will
be examined, other things that have a direct relation to law school
applications like LSAT scores and undergraduate GPAs will also be
compared and measured.

# [Data Overview]{.underline}

This dataset contains 22,407 observations with 12 variables that are
most significant in describing the students entering law school in 1991.
Reference the *codebook* for a better understanding of these variables.
6 of these variables are categorical and 6 are numerical variables.
These variables have been specifically chosen from the original, raw,
data collection after a series of decisions made to best encapsulate the
purpose of this data collection and what it was researching. (see
*Appendix: Technical Info* for more details in the data cleaning
process)

The variables gender, full-time, family income, law school tier, race,
and birth year have some NA values that will not be included in their
specific univariate and multivariate analyses, but should not have a
significant impact on the final analysis. Some data collection issues
that arose in building this report was the method in collecting data on
the law school tier for each student. This was resolved by doing further
research on the author of the original dataset/study to see with what
criteria the five tiers were constructed.

# [Data Exploration]{.underline}

To begin the exploration of this dataset, understanding the demographics
of the students in 1991 entering law school was most important to gain
any insight or conclusions in the changes in student population today.
An often overlooked demographic variable is age, and in the context of
this dataset, the age of students when entering law school (i.e. how old
they are in 1991)

### Age:

The original dataset recorded the birth year of each student. To enhance
clarity, the collected data was transformed into the age of each student
in 1991. Therefore, the reported ages represent the students' ages as of
the year 1991. It's important to note that these ages may not precisely
reflect their ages at the commencement of law school in the fall of
1991, as specific birth dates (days and months) were not provided.

Below is a histogram showing the distribution of law school entrants
ages in 1991.

![](plots/age_distribution.png)

The left-skew of this chart makes most sense because it is required for
law school students to have received an undergraduate degree before
entering law school in most states. Most college students are near the
age of 18 when entering and 21-22 when leaving, which shows the majority
of students entering law school after graduating college. However there
are a few outliers with people as old as 80 years entering law school.
For the sake of clarity, the few outliers of law school entrants over
the age were filtered out from this chart.

### Race:

This dataset separates race into five categories: Asian, Black,
Hispanic, White, and Other. Before examining the distribution of race
against any other variable in this dataset, it is important to first get
an understanding of this pool of law school entrants in 1991. Below is a
distribution of race among 22,391 students. (information on race was
missing for 16 students)

![](plots/race_distribution.png)

There is a large disparity between the number of white students versus
students of any other race for first year law school students in 1991.
This, unsurprisingly, has changed in the present day. According to the
Law School Admissions Council (LSAC), the incoming class of 2022 had
36.6% identify as students of color. More specifically, 7.8% identify as
black, 9.4% as Hispanic, and 8.9% identify as Asian. While this
information may not be the best form of comparison to this dataset (as
the LSAC also considers multi-racial as a separate category and has
other forms of identifications). There has been a larger growth in
diversity over the past three decades. Below is a more clearer
comparison of the two years.

| Race     | 1991   | 2022  |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Asian    | 4.01%  | 8.9%  |
| Black    | 6%     | 7.8%  |
| Hispanic | 4.59%  | 9.4%  |
| White    | 83.59% | 57.7% |
| Other    | 1.81   | 16.2% |

#### *Race and Family Income:*

This dataset separates the family income variable into five factors, 1-5,
with 1 being the lowest family income range and 5 being the highest.
While specific ranges of income are not specified, having five ordered
factors are helpful in comparing. After examining the large disparities
in racial identity of the law school students in 1991, examining the
intersectionality between race and income seems like a necessary step in
recreating the narrative of law school entrants in 1991.

![](plots/race_fam_inc_distribution.png) Of all Asian and white law
school entrants, most belonged to the 4th family income level. Of the
black, hispanic, and other racially-identifying students, the majority
belonged to the 3rd family income level.

### Family Income:

As mentioned previously, family income was separated into five
categories, numbered 1-5, with 1 being the lowest family income range.
Below is a table showing the distribution of family income among the law
school entrants in 1991.

![](plots/fam_inc_distribution.png)

As shown in the plot, most students belonged in the 4th family income range. Law school is a big financial decision as well as any other kind of decision so family income levels may influence this decision. However, it is unknown which applicants had their family supporting them financially for law school, but the sentiment remains that there maybe some influence one's family income has in making the decision to go to law school. 

#### *Fulltime Status and Family Income:*

When exploring the the fulltime or parttime status of students against their family income, which currently is the only variable that gives any financial identification of the student, the expectation was that students were more likely to be parttime if they were of a lower income status, for reasons such as to hold down jobs, etc. However the plot below shows a different conclusion. 
![](plots/fulltime_fam_inc.png)

There was no conclusive trend found in the proportion of fulltime and parttime students based on family income ranges. However, this does highlight law school as a large undertaking, one that probably many students intend to give their full focus to. Financial aid opportunities may also influence the decision to be fulltime vs. parttime. 

### Law School Tier: 

Law school tier ranked from 1-6 (1 being the highest) was  established by clusers 1-6 according to undergraduate GPAS and LSAT scores. Below shows the general distribution of applicants and their law school. 

![](plots/law_tier_distribution.png)

#### *Family Income and Law School Tier:*

### Law School Graduation Status: 

Naturally, not all students who entered law school in 1991 graduated law school. In fact, below shows the total count of students who did and did not graduate. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
clean |> 
  drop_na(grad) |> 
  group_by(grad) |> 
  summarize(
    count = n()
  ) |> 
  kable()

```


#### *Graduation Status and Bar Exam Status:*

This dataset shows students who at least attempted law school meaning it shows students who entered law school in fall of 1991. As it is seen earlier, there are students who did not graduate law school. However, below shows a figure that highlights an interesting conclusion about some students who did not graduate law school.  

Below shows the distribution:

![](plots/grad_bar_distribution.png) 

This may be surprising to some, to see a small amount of students who had not
graduated and attempted the bar exam, of which 65 passed! This is
because there are some states that require some amount of law school (as
in, not the full three years). These states are New York, Maine, and
West Virginia. The 65 students who passed the bar and the 24 students
who didn't pass the bar (both groups not graduating law school), must
have tried for their bar exam in any of these states.

There are also states that do not require ANY law school to attempt the
bar exam which are California, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.
However this dataset are all observations of students who entered law
school in 1991 so it is not applicable (unless the student immediately
dropped out, but that information is not available)
